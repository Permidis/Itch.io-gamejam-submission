# Copilot Instructions

## Project summary
- This is a Phaser-based brick-breaker (Arkanoid/Breakout-like) for the itch.io jam “Balls, Bricks and Phasers.”
- Core gameplay must include a paddle, one or more balls, destructible bricks, and a win/lose loop.
- Optional twists are encouraged, but the game must remain a brick-breaker and must use Phaser.

## Repository status
- This repo currently contains only [README.md](README.md) and [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- No source code, build scripts, or tests are present in the workspace.

## How to proceed
- If asked to add code, use Phaser (any version) and keep the scope to a playable brick-breaker.
- Confirm the intended Phaser version, build tooling, and target structure before creating files.
- Prefer minimal scaffolding that matches the request, since no existing conventions are discoverable.

## Reference files
- Project description is limited to [README.md](README.md).

## Gaps to clarify with the user
- Phaser version, build tooling (e.g., Vite, webpack), and expected project layout.
- Build/run/test commands and any external tooling.
- Asset sources and credit requirements for third-party assets.
