Your Task

Build an Arkanoid / Breakout-like game.

Your entry should clearly feature:

    A player-controlled paddle

    One or more balls that bounce and can be lost

    Bricks/targets that can be cleared/destroyed

    A game loop (win/lose, score, levels, etc.) 

Extra spice (optional): Add a twist (powerups, weird physics, bosses, roguelite upgrades, procedural bricks, rhythm bricks, multiball mayhem…).
Rules (simple on purpose)

    ✅ Must use Phaser (any version).

    ✅ Any libraries and plugins are allowed.

    ✅ AI assistance is welcome (code, art, writing, whatever).

    ✅ No scope constraints (team size, assets, time spent, ambition — all fine).

    ✅ Please credit third-party assets/libraries you use and only submit content you have rights to use.

    ❌ Not a brick-breaker / not Phaser = not eligible for the jam. 

Note on pre-existing work: Since this jam is intentionally relaxed, you may reuse things — just disclose it on your submission page so people understand what they’re playing.
Schedule (Europe/Athens)

    Start: Friday, 20 February 2026 — 00:01

    End / Submission Deadline: Sunday, 22 February 2026 — 23:59 

(That’s basically the whole weekend — ship something and upload before the cutoff.)
Jam Format

This jam is UNRANKED. No judging, no ratings pressure — just a showcase.

With that in mind, we can still do informal shoutouts like:

    “Most Chaotic Ball”

    “Best Feel / Juice”

    “Weirdest Bricks”

    “Most Stylish Phaser” 

(These are just for fun — no leaderboard.)
